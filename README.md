# neural-network-c
## Summary
This project is a neural network written from scratch in C to recognize handwritten digits, trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60 000, 28x28 images of handwritten digits intended for training a neural network, with an additional 10 000 images intended to test a model on data it's never seen before. Each pixel is as assigned an 8-bit 'brightness' value between 0 - 255, which can then be passed into the model. The intention of the this project was to learn the internal workings and structure of a feedforward neural network using a 'learn by doing' method. The choice to use no other librariers other than the standard C libraries was explicit such that it forces the development of fully custom network functions and structure (whether or not OpenMP is an external library is debatable - It is an API for interacting with the operating system). This read me serves as a (WIP) detailed design overview for this project.
